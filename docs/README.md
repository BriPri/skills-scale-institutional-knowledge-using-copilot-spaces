# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme’s project management documentation. This README summarizes OctoAcme’s project management approach and links to the process documents stored in this folder. Use this as the primary entrypoint for onboarding, quick reference, and navigation.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

- Customer-first focus and iterative delivery — prioritize outcomes and deliver value in small, testable increments.
- Clearly defined roles — Product Manager, Project Manager, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders each have responsibilities and decision rights.
- Transparent workflows and artifacts — charters, roadmaps, sprint plans, and risk registers are documented and shared.
- Repeatable lifecycle — Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective, with explicit artifacts at each stage.
- Communication cadence — regular syncs (standups, planning, demos, retros) and stakeholder updates to maintain alignment and enable timely decisions.
