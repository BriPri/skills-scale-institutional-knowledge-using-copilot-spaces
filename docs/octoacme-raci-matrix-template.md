# OctoAcme RACI Matrix Template

## Purpose
A RACI matrix clarifies role responsibilities for key project activities. Use this template to define who is **Responsible**, **Accountable**, **Consulted**, and **Informed** for each activity.

## RACI Definitions

| Code | Definition | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **R** | Responsible | The person(s) who perform the work to complete the activity |
| **A** | Accountable | The person who is ultimately answerable for the activity's completion (only one per activity) |
| **C** | Consulted | The person(s) whose input is sought before a decision or action |
| **I** | Informed | The person(s) who are kept up-to-date on progress or decisions |

## How to Use This Template

1. List all key project activities in the left column
2. Add all relevant roles across the top row
3. Assign R, A, C, or I to each cell
4. Ensure each activity has exactly one **A** (Accountable)
5. Review with stakeholders to confirm alignment
6. Update as roles or activities change

## Example: Customizing the RACI Matrix

Adapt this template to your project by:

- Adding or removing roles based on your team structure
- Adding project-specific activities
- Adjusting responsibility assignments based on your organizational context

### Tips

- **Avoid too many Rs**: If multiple people are Responsible, clarify who does what
- **One A per row**: Only one person should be Accountable for each activity
- **Review regularly**: Update the matrix as the project evolves
- **Share widely**: Ensure all team members have access to the current version
